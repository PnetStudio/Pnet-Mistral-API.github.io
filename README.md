Example

Here is an example of a question you can ask Mistral:

How to write a function to find the largest number in an array?
Mistral will answer this question with the following code:

function findMax(array) {
  let max = array[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] > max) {
      max = array[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}
You can also ask more open-ended questions, such as:

What is general relativity?
Mistral will answer this question with an explanatory text, such as:

General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century. It describes gravitation as a curvature of spacetime due to the presence of mass and energy.

General relativity has revolutionized our understanding of gravity. It has allowed us to explain phenomena such as the motion of planets around the Sun, the bending of light by gravity, and the formation of black holes.
